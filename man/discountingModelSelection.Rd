\usage{
discountingModelSelection(
  dat,
  A = NULL,
  models = c("all"),
  idCol = "id",
  detailed = FALSE,
  figures = FALSE,
  summarize = FALSE,
  lineSize = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{data frame with X column and Y column (0 <= Y <= 1, NOTE capitalized letters)}

\item{A}{OPTIONAL: The maximum value of the commodity (e.g., of 100 USD, out of 1, etc.)}

\item{models}{vector of models to include in selection. Includes "noise", "hyperbolic", "exponential", "laibson", "greenmyerson", "rachlin", "ebertprelec", "crdi", and "genhyp".  All models are included by specifying "all" or leaving the parameter at default ("all").}

\item{idCol}{string content identifying participants (e.g., idCol = "ids")}

\item{detailed}{include additional output details in results (TRUE/FALSE, FALSE by default)}

\item{figures}{OPTIONAL: show figure of results. Includes "ed50" for ed50 plotting, "auc" for numerical integration with normal delays, and "logauc" for numerical integration with log base 10 scaled delays.}

\item{summarize}{OPTIONAL: Descriptive observations (TRUE/FALSE, FALSE by default)}

\item{lineSize}{OPTIONAL: Modify line sizes for figures (numeric, 1 by default)}
}
\value{
A data frame of model parameters

data frame of fitted model parameters
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame of temporal discounting values (X, Y) and performs approximate Bayesian model selection using the Bayesian Information Criterion and returns the log of the Effective Delay 50 and numerical integration area.
