Description: This R package provides a base source of methods for applying approximate Bayesian model selection for discount models commonly (and less commonly) used in the existing literature.  A range of models and fitting apparatus are included a Bayesian model averaging procedure is included to determine "true" models for individual instances of temporal discounting.  Models presently included as a model candidates are the Exponential (Samuelson, 1937), the Hyperbolic (Mazur, 1987), the Generalized Hyperboloid (Rodriguez & Logue, 1997), the Quasi-Hyperbolic (Laibson, 1997), the Green & Myerson (Green & Myerson, 2004), the Ebert & Prelec Constant Sensitivity Model (Ebert & Prelec, 2007), and the Bleichrodt et al. Constant Relative Decreasing Impatience Model (Bleichrodt et al., 2009).  An intercept-only model is also included (Noise) as a simpler alternative to the included models.  Following the model selection procedure, generalized indices are performed upon the "true" model for each series.  Generalized indices include the Effective Delay 50 (ED50; Yoon & Higgins, 2008) as well as numerical integration performed upon the "true" model in normal and log10 scaling.
